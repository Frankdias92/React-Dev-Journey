<h1 align="center"> React Dev Journey </h1>

<p align="center">

Learning React was a turning point for me. I confess it was challenging, and I had many doubts at the beginning, especially about where to start. Through extensive research and studies in the documentation, I embarked on some initial projects, and luckily, I ended up joining the Rocketseat community, where I gained access to their Ignite course, allowing me to learn significantly through practical projects.

Throughout the classes with Diego, CEO of Rocketseat, I acquired valuable knowledge and tips.

During this learning journey, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects covering different areas and skills. Over time, I built a significant portfolio that reflects my professional growth and acquired skills.

These experiences not only provided me with valuable learning but also allowed me to develop a holistic approach to handling projects, from the planning phase to the final delivery. By accumulating these projects, I am confident in my ability to face new challenges and contribute significantly to future initiatives.

**React Fundamentals:**
A React application was built using Vite and I learned about the most important concepts of react, including componentization, properties, states, immutability and hooks, in addition to applying TypeScript to our project to add static typing to the application.
